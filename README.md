# Lens Mind

## :right_anger_bubble: Overview
- Lens Mind is a more Transparent, Secure and User-Friendly Social Media platform built on the Lens protocol, which allows us to offer a truly Decentralized experience to our users. This means that you, as a user, have full Ownership and Control over your Data and Content. No more worrying about your personal information being Sold to Advertisers or Third-party companies without your Consent.

- Currently all the well-established Social Media giants have complete access over our data and privacy. They can easily **Manipulate** your data or even **sell** it for ads or small margins. This is a major flaw in the current centralized world. They can choose to suspend your account anytime they want and all of your **Hard-Earned** Followers, Content and even your Revenue stream will be gone in a flash.

- This issue can be solved if we make this process completely Decentralized and **Tamper-Proof** so that no single central authority have the rights to perform actions on its own. For this we have used **Lens Protocol** as the backbone to create our own social media.
  
- You can view people's posts and profiles as we make **graphQL** queries on the Lens Protcol Server in the backend. You can create your own profile, update your profile metadata, follow other users, share your posts and interact with other's posts as well with the help of graphQL mutations that writes directly to the lens smart contracts so that your data is completely safe and stored over a decentralized platform.

- We have also added the unique feature of meeting rooms, powered by Huddle01. With Huddle01, you can create private or public meeting rooms within the app, where you can collaborate, share ideas, and connect with like-minded individuals. Our meeting rooms offer a safe and secure space for users to connect.

- Users need to connect their wallet and sign up before they can perform any action.
- If a user does not have any profile, they need to create it after signing the signature.
- This is how their profile looks after logging.
