## Lens Mind

### Lens Mind is more transparent, secure, and user-controlled social media platform built on the Lens protocol, which allows us to offer a truly decentralized experience to our users. This means that you, as a user, have full ownership and control over your data and content. No more worrying about your personal information being sold to advertisers or third-party companies without your consent. 

### By utilizing graphQL queries you can view other people's posts and profiles. You can also create your own profile, update your profile metadata, follow other users, share your posts and interact with other's posts as well with the help of graphQL mutations that writes directly to the lens smart contracts so that your data is completely safe and stored over a decentralized platform.

### We have also added the unique feature of meeting rooms, powered by Huddle01. With Huddle01, you can create private or public meeting rooms within the app, where you can collaborate, share ideas, and connect with like-minded individuals. Whether you're a small team working on a project, a group of friends planning a trip, or a community organizing a virtual event, our meeting rooms offer a safe and secure space for you to come together and achieve your goals.
